APPSCATTER_IAP-module

IAP (In App Purchasing)

AIM
App module/SDK that Appscatter can distribute that will allow app developers the ability to perform in-app purchases in a single code base across multiple app stores relevant to where it was downloaded from. 

We will need to support stores with Native IAP integration, for stores without we will integrate Fortumo (https://fortumo.com/). The SDK will need to standardise the purchasing process across all the stores so the work from the app developer perspective (end user), is minimal. 

Once a module/SDK have been developed NATIVELY we intend to roll it out to support Hybrid development platforms for example: Appcelerator (http://www.appcelerator.com/), PhoneGap (http://phonegap.com/), Cordova (https://cordova.apache.org/)
